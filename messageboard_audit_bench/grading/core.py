"""What a grade is: the sheets, the prompt, the parsing, the arithmetic, the path.

Every definition here was lifted from benchmark/rubrics/grade_with_rubrics.py rather than
rewritten, because 719 committed grade files were produced by that code and must remain
reproducible from it. The legacy script now imports these functions instead of defining
them, so the two paths cannot diverge; tests/test_grading_aggregate_parity.py replays every
committed file through `aggregate` to prove the arithmetic still matches.

No provider clients and no network here. `build_prompt` returns the three pieces a caller
needs — system, a cacheable prefix, and the suffix carrying the report — and each caller
assembles them the way its own API wants. That split is the Anthropic cache breakpoint in
the legacy script and the block ordering in the Inspect scorer, and it is why the same
bytes reach the judge either way.
