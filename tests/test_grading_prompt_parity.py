"""The bytes that reach the judge, pinned.

Every score in the corpus is a function of the exact prompt that produced it. A stray
whitespace change in a sheet, a reordered substitution, a sheet renumbered — any of those
would silently reprice all 719 grades, and nothing else in the suite would notice, because
a judge given a slightly different prompt still returns plausible numbers.

So this fixes the assembled prompt for a committed report against a recorded digest, per
mode. The digests below were taken when the grading core was factored out of
benchmark/rubrics/grade_with_rubrics.py, and were verified byte-for-byte against that
script as it stood immediately before the refactor, for all five modes.

A failure here is not necessarily a bug: editing a rubric sheet is a legitimate act and
will trip it. It means "the judge is now being asked something different, and grades made
before this change are no longer comparable with grades made after it" — update the digest
in the same commit as the sheet edit, and say so in the message.
